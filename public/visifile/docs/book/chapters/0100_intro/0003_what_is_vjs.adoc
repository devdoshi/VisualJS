VisualJS is a tool for building internal business applications. It has a drag and drop UI builder and uses Javascript as a scripting language. In some ways VisualJS can be thought of as a very lightweight version of Visual Basic. A few points of compariston to Visual Basic are:

- Visual Basic runs only on Windows whereas VisualJS is multi-platform
- Visual Basic is a proprietary product whereas VisualJS is open source
- Visual Basic uses basic as a scripting language whereas VisualJS uses Javascript
- VisualJS lacks the module system of Visual Basic
- Visual Basic applications compile to a .exe whereas VisualJS apps are distributed as a HTML file or as the VisualJS he run time plus a .vjs file
